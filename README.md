# STA2453_project


This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting patient recovery time using MRI scans and demographic data. The goal is to provide insights into recovery patterns and help inform future clinical decision-making. This project uses both machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze brain images and clinical features.

## How to Use

Perfect â€” Iâ€™ll write a **polished, professional README update** that:

- Shows where your `example/` folder fits
- Explains **how to quickly run** the reproducible example
- Makes your repo very clean and easy for others to navigate!

# ðŸ“„ Example README Update

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and models for predicting concussion recovery time using 3D brain MRI data and demographic information.  
It includes MRI preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a lightweight example to quickly demonstrate the workflow without full retraining.

â”œâ”€â”€ example/               # Example usage: quick run with pretrained model
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # CNN model definitions

## Quick Start: Example Usage

You can **run a reproducible example** directly without training the model from scratch.

### 1. Install Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:
```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas matplotlib h5py tqdm seaborn
```

### 2. Run the Example

```bash
cd example
python reproducible_example.py
```

This script will:
- Load sample MRI + demographic data
- Generate predicted recovery times
- Plot predicted vs. actual recovery times

âœ…You can reproduce the key results in just a few seconds.

## Notes
- MRI data volumes were reconstructed using a brain mask and saved in H5 format.
- The target variable is log-transformed recovery time (`log(d_Recov + 1)`).
- Original MRI shape is saved in `original_shape.npy` for reproducibility.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Data Cleaning:** The raw MRI data and masks are stored in HDF5 files. The code cleans and organizes these data for further analysis.
- **Masking:** The brain mask is applied to each MRI scan to remove non-brain regions.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA and other methods are used to reduce the high-dimensional MRI data.
- **Model Training:** Both machine learning and deep learning techniques are explored to predict recovery time from the extracted features.
- **Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using various performance metrics to determine the best approach.
